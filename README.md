# 100-days-of-code-from-the-beginning
My 100 days of code challenge, through Code Academy, starting from the essentials, or the beginning.

I've been teaching myself to code for a few months now and I was challenged to this 100 Days Of Code Challenge. 
I didnt want to just begin making projects, I want to use this to better myself as a developer. So i've decided
to start over from scratch and begin the courses through Code Academy, beginning at step one and see how much I 
progress in the next 100 Days. I've created certain project guidelines for myself to do to practice during those 
100 days, and all of it will be included here in this repository.
